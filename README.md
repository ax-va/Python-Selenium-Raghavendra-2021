# Selenium4-Raghavendra-2021

The use of Selenium and Python is demonstrated based on Sujay Raghavendra's book "Python Testing with Selenium: Learn to Implement Different Testing Techniques Using the Selenium WebDriver" published by Apress in 2021. The book's examples have been modified and updated, including for changes in Selenium 4. They end with an introduction to unittest and writing a Google search unittest.

You can see the examples in the 'examples' directory and the tests in the 'tests' one. In the 'utils' folder, the Highlither class is introduced for highlighting HTML elements. Additionally, in the 'pom' folder, the Page Object Model is sketched and represented in a very simple form. The webdrivers containing in the project may be out of date, in which case you need to update them or download them in a different way than suggested here.

Verified with versions: python 3.8+, selenium 4.8.2, webdriver-manager 3.8.5, PyAutoGUI 0.9.53, Pillow 9.4.0.
