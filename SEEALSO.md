The project has two primary goals:

1. Provide a common, high-level API on top of existing browser automation tools such as Selenium. 
The API is an abstraction layer that is human-friendly and designed for easy, efficient scripting.

2. Provide built-in functionality to handle common pain points with browser automation.
